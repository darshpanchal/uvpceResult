# uvpceResult
This Script automates process of checking result of UVPCE.

First you will need python 2.7 installed not python 3.

Second you have to install 3 dependencies:
  1: win10toast:
    To install use command "pip install win10toast" (without inverted comma).
  2: mechanize:
    To install mechanize use command "pip install mechanize" (without inverted comma). 
  3: BeautifulSoup:
    To install use command "pip install beautifulsoup" (without inverted comma).
There are 2 python scripts. One is to check that whether result is updated or not, and second is to fetch result in form of .html file directly on your PC without even surfing site. 

Put both scripts in same folder and if you want to put CheckResult script in startup then put a shortcut in startup folder.

Other instructions will be commented in code directly.
